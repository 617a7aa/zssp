/// inputs and outputs.
/// This is to enforced a basic sanity-check upon anyone trying to use their own implementations.
///
/// The `crypto_impl` module contains implementations of these traits in terms of popular Rust
/// implementations of these algorithms.

/// be FIPS compliant. However lack of FIPS compliance by no means implies lack of security or lack
/// of confidence.

/// This module contains the trait implementations as well as re-exports of those crates.
